## Rock–Paper–Scissors Image Classification using CNN (PyTorch)

</div>


## 1️⃣ Introduction

This project presents an end-to-end implementation of a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for **Rock–Paper–Scissors (RPS)** hand gesture classification using **PyTorch**.  
The model is trained on **two standard benchmark datasets** and evaluated on both **in-distribution data** and **real-world smartphone images** to analyze generalization performance.

The goal of this project is not only to achieve high accuracy but also to **study the limitations of CNN models when deployed in real-world environments**.

## 4️⃣ CNN Architecture

The CNN consists of **three convolutional blocks** followed by a **fully connected classifier**.

### 4.1 Model Implementation

```python
class CNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_classes=3):
        super().__init__()

        self.features = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Conv2d(3, 32, kernel_size=3, padding=1),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.MaxPool2d(2),

            nn.Conv2d(32, 64, kernel_size=3, padding=1),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.MaxPool2d(2),

            nn.Conv2d(64, 128, kernel_size=3, padding=1),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.MaxPool2d(2),
        )

        self.classifier = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(128 * 28 * 28, 256),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Dropout(0.5),
            nn.Linear(256, num_classes)
        )

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.features(x)
        x = x.view(x.size(0), -1)
        return self.classifier(x)

* Several incorrect predictions
* Reduced confidence scores
* Clear performance degradation

---

## 7️⃣ Why Does the Model Fail on Real Phone Images?

Despite excellent performance on standard datasets, the model struggles on real phone images due to the following reasons:

### 7.1 Domain Shift (Primary Reason)

Training images are captured in controlled environments, while phone images introduce:

* Different backgrounds
* lighting variations
* Camera noise and blur
* Scale and orientation differences

This creates a **distribution mismatch** between training and testing data.

---

### 7.2 Background Bias

The CNN unintentionally learns background-related features instead of purely hand geometry.
When the background changes, predictions become unreliable.

---

### 7.3 Limited Model Capacity

The CNN is trained from scratch and lacks the representational power of large pretrained models.

---

### 7.4 Small Real-World Sample Size

Only **10 phone images** are insufficient for real-world adaptation.

---

## 8️⃣ Key Insight

> High validation accuracy does **not guarantee real-world robustness**.

This project demonstrates a common deep learning limitation:
**CNNs generalize poorly outside their training distribution without domain adaptation or transfer learning.**

---

## 9️⃣ Future Improvements

* Apply **Transfer Learning** (ResNet, MobileNet)
* Collect more real-world images
* Use background randomization
* Perform fine-tuning on phone images

---

## 🔟 Conclusion

This project demonstrates:

* A complete CNN-based image classification pipeline
* Strong performance on two benchmark datasets
* Clear analysis of real-world generalization failure

The results emphasize the importance of **data diversity and domain alignment** in deep learning systems.
